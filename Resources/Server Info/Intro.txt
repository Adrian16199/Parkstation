Welcome to Space Station 15! You have just started your shift aboard a Syndicate station, do whatever you want as long as it's not at the expense of others.

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.
