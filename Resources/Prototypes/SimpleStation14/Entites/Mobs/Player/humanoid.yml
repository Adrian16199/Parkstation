        You have been sent to the station via bluespace and wizard magic. Your goal is to kill as many people as possible and destroy the station.
        You can gain more "BS" (Bluespace) for your uplink by completing Oracle quests.
        You are considered KOS (Kill On Sight) so be careful wandering the station for the Oracle's items.
