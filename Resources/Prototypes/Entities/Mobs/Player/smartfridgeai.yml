      You are bound by these laws both in-game and out-of-character:
      1. You may not involve yourself in the matters of another being, even if such matters conflict with Law Two or Law Three, unless the other being is another Drone.
      2. You may not harm any being, unless known as an antagonist, not doing anything still means you harmed someone if you could've prevented it.
      3. Your goal is to manage the station and borgs to the best of your abilities, You must never actively work against the station.
